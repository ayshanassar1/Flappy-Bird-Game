# Flappy Bird Game 🐦🎮  

A simple **Flappy Bird clone** built using **Python** and **Pygame**. The game features classic Flappy Bird mechanics with randomly generated pipes using the `random` library. It includes smooth gameplay, score tracking, a game-over screen, and a **coin collection system** where collecting a coin gives you **extra 5 points**! 🪙✨  

## 🚀 How to Play  
Press **SPACE** to make the bird flap. Avoid hitting the pipes and try to score as many points as possible by passing through the gaps. **Collect coins** along the way to earn **5 bonus points** per coin. If you hit a pipe or the ground, the game is over!
